Often there's a desire to encapsulate information next to the actual message we receive as input. This often goes by a name ending with the word Context in a lot of other products. Here I called it WorkflowTrigger. It can be useful at times if the workflow surrounding code treats the head and body of a message as distinct parts, but it's not strictly necessary. The workflow trigger could have properties which we tend to classify as metadata or headers, e.g. source, message name, message version, causation and correlation identifiers, ... next to the body. The main motivation to use this is when the workflow code itself uses it as part of its decision making process. If not, then it's just noise.
